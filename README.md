Download the repository: click download ZIP on the right of the screen and extract the zip file to your computer or clone the repository using Git.

Navigate to where you unzipped the file or cloned the repository.
In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. However, if you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's website to download and install the software.


To set up your server with Python
In a terminal, check the version of Python you have:
python -V

If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80

This project uses port 80.

For Python 3.x, you can use python3 -m http.server 80 or py -m http.server 80
